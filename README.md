# Notchification
Beautiful, responsive animations, when receiving notifications on jailbroken device

## About

Notification shows responsive, dynamic animations when receiving notifications on a jailbroken device. Built with (Airbnb's Lottie)[https://github.com/lottiefiles] animation framework. 
Animations are created in Adobe AfterEffects, rendered and exported to a JSON text file, via [BodyMovin](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.12557.bodymovin.html)
And rendered on device. Additonally, there are some dynamic animations, which can read the color of the triggering-app's icon color.

These were build using iOSOpenDev Xcode toolset, in addition to theos

I no longer actively maintain these tweaks, however, I will do my best to answer questions and provide direction to anyone interested in contributing, or just generally curious about the software.
